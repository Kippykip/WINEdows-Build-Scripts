# WINEdows-Build-Scripts
Here's a bunch of scripts I wrote that converts an Xubuntu 20.04 Focal distro into a WINEdows distro.

# Instructions
Basically copy project_main into your Cubic Xubuntu, go to the project_main folder (cd project_main), then run ./convert_xubuntu.sh  
You may have to do this beforehand?:  
chmod +x convert_xubuntu.sh  

For a quick and dirty conversion, you can also run qqconvert_xubuntu.sh instead. It's basically a lite version just to check if the core is working without having to download hundreds of packages.
